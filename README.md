# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

    Lot 1 is NOT significantly different from the population mean (with a p-value of 1)

    Lot 2 is NOT significantly different from the population mean (with a p-value of 0.61)

    Lot 3 IS significantly different from the population mean (with a p-value of 0.042)

Deliverable 4: Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition
