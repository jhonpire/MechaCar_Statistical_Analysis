# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

In this challenge, you’ll help Jeremy and the data analytics team do the following:

Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you’ll write a summary interpretation of the findings.


This new assignment consists of three technical analysis deliverables and a proposal for further statistical study. You’ll submit the following:

Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Deliverable 3: T-Test on Suspension Coils

Lot 1 is NOT significantly different from the population mean (with a p-value of 1)
